# H_see_eye

This repository contains two main folders:

### **HCI मन की बात**
This folder contains questions that you can answer in your own words. The answers here are more open-ended and flexible, allowing for personal insights and perspectives on HCI concepts.

### **HCI Concepts**
This folder contains questions related to key HCI concepts, such as principles, heuristics, and other theory-based topics. These answers require more precision and accuracy, as they are concept-based and demand a clearer understanding of HCI principles.
